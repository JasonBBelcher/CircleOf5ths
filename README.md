# CircleOf5ths

This is a simple tool to quickly find a key signature or chord progression
to work with when starting a new song. 

click around on the UI and hear the relationship of key signatures to one another.  Pretty darn neat eh?






### TO DO 

*  refactor css 
*  Label all divs with correct note/chord
*  some kind of switch to select between click/mouseover behavior.  
*  add extra sound assets with a way to select between them.  Default is organ.
