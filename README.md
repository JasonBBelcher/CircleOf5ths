# CircleOf5ths

This is a simple tool to quickly find a key signature or chord progression
to work with when starting a new song. 

click around on the UI and hear the relationship of key signatures to one another.  Pretty darn neat eh?
Each key signature is represented by each arm of the circular pattern. 





### TO DO 

*  refactor css 
*  color each key differently to indicate what it is.  
*  some kind of switch to select between click/mouseover behavior.  
*  add extra sound assets with a way to select between them.  Default is organ.
